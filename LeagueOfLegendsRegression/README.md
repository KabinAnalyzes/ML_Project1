# League of Legends Linear Regression Project

This project was a part of Math 158, Statistical Linear Models, at Pomona College. The project consisted of finding a large, suitable dataset for Linear Regression and applying statistical tests, methods, and exploratory data analysis on it to find patterns. Then developing a Linear Regression model based on the data. Along with the Markdown file with the code for the project there is also a PDF detailing the specific statistical methods used and the thought process behind each part of the project.
